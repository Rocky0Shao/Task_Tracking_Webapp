today (12/27) i restarted the project from setup, as tailwind css was broken. 

I will first make components/task.txs, to return a li of task.
i will make a type of task, following supabase table format.


I created custom hook to add task to the unordered list and toggle individual tasks by their unique id.

Currently the "task-list" is a dummy list of tasks. I'll change it to actually use supabse.
